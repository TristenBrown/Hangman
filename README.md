# Hangman
JavaFX hangman application

Along with the usual hangman functions, this application pulls from an api that uses a scrable dictionary, meaning it can be fairly difficult.
It also uses sqlite in order to maintain and update highscore records.
The zip file contains the entire JavaFX application.
